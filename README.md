# Stronghold Crusader Dashboard

## What is this project about?

Stronghold Crusader Dashboard is a python based CLI and dashboard app designed to track and visualize Stronghold Crusader Extreme statistics.

[Stronghold Crusader Extreme](https://fireflyworlds.com/games/strongholdcrusader/) is a real time strategy game made by Firefly Studios.
While the game does feature a stats screen after each match, it does miss more modern features like a graph of stats over time and some deeper statistics. This project aims to provide easily explorable stat tracking for your Stronghold Crusader Extreme matches.

## Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by the constant work and videos from [Udwin](https://www.youtube.com/@Udwin),[Krarilotus](https://www.youtube.com/@Krarilotus),[Xander10alpha](https://www.youtube.com/@Xander10alpha) and many more.
Most of the work figuring out the memory adresses was already done in other [projects](https://github.com/patel-nikhil/SHCLiveStatReader) by [patel-nikhil](https://github.com/patel-nikhil) and others.
